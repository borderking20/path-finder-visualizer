# path-finder-visualizer

Overview

Pathfinder Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and visualize various pathfinding algorithms. This project provides a visual representation of how these algorithms work, making it easier to grasp their underlying mechanics and differences. It supports a variety of algorithms and allows users to create custom grids, set start and end points, and observe the algorithms in action.

Features

Custom Grid Creation: Users can create grids of any size and place obstacles to simulate complex environments.
Multiple Algorithms: Includes popular pathfinding algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra's, BFS (Breadth-First Search), and DFS (Depth-First Search).
Interactive Visualization: Watch the algorithms in action as they explore the grid and find the shortest path.
Dynamic Obstacles: Add or remove obstacles dynamically and see how the algorithms adapt.
Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the visualization to better observe the algorithms' behavior.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface designed for users of all levels.

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Usage

Create a Grid: Use the interface to create a grid of your desired size.
Set Start and End Points: Click on the grid to set the start and end points for the pathfinding algorithm.
Add Obstacles: Add obstacles by clicking on the grid cells. These will act as barriers that the algorithm must navigate around.
Choose an Algorithm: Select a pathfinding algorithm from the available options.
Visualize: Click the 'Visualize' button to see the algorithm in action. Adjust the speed if necessary to observe the process in more detail.
Reset: Use the reset button to clear the grid and start over.
Algorithms Implemented
A*: A popular algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in finding the shortest path.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: A classic algorithm that guarantees the shortest path in weighted grids.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all possible paths layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted grids.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, which may not guarantee the shortest path.
